## What should I do if I get stuck with a white screen at startup?

The opening image of flaming EA is actually loading game resources, and the problem occurs at startup, mostly when it starts loading. 
There are two possible explanations for this situation, either the rendering of the flames at the beginning tends to cause crashes, or the problem is caused by auto-adjustment of the resolution(invalid in latest version). 
Many people who have encountered this problem have resolved it after several attempts, so we recommend that you try it again and again. In addition, most of the white screen cases we have recorded so far are using Lenovo laptops, so please refer to your computer configuration to make a judgement.

## Where are the sandbox levels?

There is a “Sandbox Level” button on the game's settings screen. 
Once inside, there is a purple “i” button, click on it to get a description of the keys.

Middle-click on a plant in the field to trigger a plant food effect.
Use the keyboard to automatically match the spare Banana Rocket or Missile Toe on the field.
Use the [b] key for the former and the [n] key for the latter.
Press [~] to hide UI. 

## Why is there no zombie in the zomboss level?

The Zomboss Mechs are still under development, patience is virtue. 

## Why is there Tutorial Zombies in some of the World Levels? Or the level is not playable?

Tutorial Zombies and Peashooters are usually placeholders of the uncompleted Zombies or Plants. 

They will be replaced by what they should have been in vanilla in the future.

## The full screen resolution is so weird, what should I do?

Initial launch of the game is fixed full screen, press F4 to cancel the full screen. 

Currently the game has been UI adapted for 16:10 and 16:9 screens, if you have problems about screen display, please reflect them to 
the author and we will fix them as soon as possible.

## Why are the UI gone?

Press the [~] key to hide UI, please check if the UI is hidden by pressing this key by mistake.
If invalid, unfortunately this problem might be brought by the devices you are using.

## Why is the plant all unlocked in the first place?

The archive feature is still under development, that's why all the plants and levels are fully unlocked from the beginning, and we will add this feature in future versions.

In addition, clicking on the plus sign on the side of the gold and diamonds can directly increase their number, in the future, if you select [ALLOW CHEAT] in the Settings, this function will still be retained, if you do not allow cheating, this function will allow you to exchange gold and diamonds with each other.
