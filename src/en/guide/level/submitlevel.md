You can download level files made by community members on the [Community Level](/en/custom-level/) page. If you have your own levels, you can share them with other players in the following ways:

## 1. Discord Server

You can share your level files on the `#custom-level-share` channel of the Discord server. Please follow the server rules.

To join the Discord server, please check the [User Community Page](/en/contribution/).

## 2. Submit to the Official Level Library

If your level is highly completed, you can submit it to the official level library. You need to have a Github account and be able to use Git tools.

For how to use Git, please refer to the [Official Development Guide](/en/guide/webGuide). Please note that the official Git repository is different from the level library.

The address of the official level library is: [pvzg_level](https://github.com/Gzh0821/pvzg_level).

Please refer to the Readme file of the official level library for detailed steps to submit a level.
