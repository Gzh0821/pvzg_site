### How do i update?

A: Download the new version from the official Gardendless' website. You can keep/delete the old one if you want to.

### How do i transfer my progress between versions? (when updating)

A: Your save files transfer between versions automatically. Download a new version and play!

### Why is my game crashing/really  slow/doesn't run/laggy/has gray screens?

A: The game's optimization isn't the best at the moment. You can try closing tabs, but if nothing works, sadly, your device doesn't meet the requirements to run GE.

### Is modding possible? What can you mod into the game?

A: With GEPatcher, modding IS possible, however, as of writing this, it's really limited. You cannot change core game features/add new plants, zombies or worlds.

### Is there an Android/IOS/Linux port of the game?

A: There is currently a fresh Linux port of the game listed on the website. However, you cannot download it on Android/IOS.

### How do i spawn gravestones/minecarts/puddles/etc in Sandbox mode?

A: You can't. As of now, you can only spawn potions, plants and zombies in Sandbox mode.

### How do i get plants with the purple night background?

A: Those are Epic Quest plants, and can only be obtained through epic quests.

### How do i enter an epic quest?

A: Inside of a world, there are often sublevels (ex. 14-1). Upon completing them, a portal will open leading to an Epic Quest.

### The audio is really buggy for me, what do i do?

A: There have been numerous attempts to fix it, but if you still have this issue, it may be because of your device specifications.

### Is the game a virus? Why is it triggering my firewall?

A: No, the game is not a virus, it triggers the firewall because it doesn't have a license. Just click "Read more" and "Run anyway".

### What does the zen garden do?

A: As of now, the Zen Garden does nothing and only exists to obtain marigold (by growing her in zen garden).

### Why can i use the powerups/plantfood/maximize my sun for free?

A: Then, the "Cheat" option in the settings is enabled for you. If you want an experience without these cheats, you can turn it off in the settings.

### Why are some gem plants not in the shop? How do i get them?

A: Some gem plants can only be bought from the shop after a certain level in some worlds.

### Why do some sublevels (ex. 22-1) not have an Epic Quest portal?

A: Those are just extra levels, they wont get you any plants.

### Why is Ancient Egypt 25/26 suddenly so hard?

A: Any level after the Zomboss fight is an expansion level. It's recommended to play them later when you have a sufficient amount of different plants.

### Will leveling get added?

A: No. Leveling won't be added to Gardendless.

### Can Gardendless be played on Mac/Linux?

A: Yes, you can play Gardendless on Mac/Linux using Winebottler or Docker.

### How do i get my save data in Gardendless?

A: To get your save data, you have to enter the game, in the main menu, click on your profile (your name), and click the button "Export".

### What is the save editor? How do I access it?

A: Save editor lets you change different values in your save file, such as coins, gems or unlocked plants. The save editor is located in the website, in useful tools category.

## NOTES

The game has 4 difficulties, A, B, C, D, going in order from A being the hardest to D being the easiest. If the game is weirdly hard for you, it may be because the default difficulty is A.

If a level is missing some features/zomboss, then its because it's not fully developed yet.

Some plants cannot be obtained without cheating right now: Resistant Radish, Heavenly Peach, Floawerpot, Skyshooter, Moonbean, Shooting Starfruit, Dragon Bruit.
