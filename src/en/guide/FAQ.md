## What's not Chinese?

This game is available in English only, and is not available in Chinese.

- Explanation： for Halibut

pvz2 The game is international and national. The international uniforms are folklored and the official hanging of the State uniforms is less than ideal.

First, in order to restore the international edition, our primary objective of the current version is to restore the international version and to make some of our features, which indeed have been seen.

So it is to restore and use the same English as the international version.

Second, in the way this game is played, the impact on the play process is not very large and can be graded but not at this stage.

Finally, if a decision is made as to which version is to be adopted, the choice of folklore or the choice of official hanging will be disregarded.The horizontal portrait is not.

Then, hanization is particularly difficult if it is to selfish the game.Because it has a variety of dilemmas in English, it is likely to lose this unique interest if it is spoken.

Moreover, some have said that “whistle-blowing” makes it all the more difficult for us to set aside for the time being.

For the time being, we have no plans to open the version as soon as it is possible that someone will try to grab it and make it inconveniently for you. I hope you will understand it.

There is only one fan that has tried to make the Hangized version, but no recent update has been followed up, several versions of the latest progress have fallen behind and are not recommended.

## What should I do if I get stuck with a white screen at startup?

The opening image of flaming EA is actually loading game resources, and the problem occurs at startup, mostly when it starts loading.
There are two possible explanations for this situation, either the rendering of the flames at the beginning tends to cause crashes, or the problem is caused by auto-adjustment of the resolution(invalid in latest version).
Many people who have encountered this problem have resolved it after several attempts, so we recommend that you try it again and again. In addition, most of the white screen cases we have recorded so far are using Lenovo laptops, so please refer to your computer configuration to make a judgement.

There are currently two possible explanations for the fact that the rendering of the first flame can easily lead to collapse, and problems are caused by the automatic adjustment of resolution.

The next version will make it possible to turn off the resolution function automatically, or will solve the problem.

Many people who have encountered this problem try to solve it several times, so we recommend that you try again and again.

Also, if you are downloads from the web disk, you can try to download resources in the block, we have encountered multiple players who are unable to run the web version but can run the group version.

The reasons for that phenomenon were not yet clear, but the documents uploaded should be the same document.

## Where are the sandbox levels?

There is a “Sandbox Level” button on the game's settings screen.
Once inside, there is a purple “i” button, click on it to get a description of the keys.

## Why is the monarchy puzzle not stranded?

Piracy and the Egyptian monarchy are still being produced, and please be patient, with the current version being developed to complete only the piracy and Egyptian worlds, but not yet in the west.

## Why are there other puzzles not bizzing?

Some of the mini-game gates in the mystery of Egypt and the Bay of Piracy and the second half of the western gate are still being produced, and it is not surprising that they were not completed.

## The full screen resolution is so weird, what should I do?

Initial launch of the game is fixed full screen, press F4 to cancel the full screen.

## Why is the plant all unlocked in the first place?

The archive feature is still under development, that's why all the plants and levels are fully unlocked from the beginning, and we will add this feature in future versions.请您稍安勿躁。Please, be resisted.

In addition, clicking on the plus sign on the side of the gold and diamonds can directly increase their number, in the future, if you select [ALLOW CHEAT] in the Settings, this function will still be retained, if you do not allow cheating, this function will allow you to exchange gold and diamonds with each other.
