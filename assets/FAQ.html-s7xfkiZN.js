There are two possible explanations for this situation, either the rendering of the flames at the beginning tends to cause crashes, or the problem is caused by auto-adjustment of the resolution(invalid in latest version). Many people who have encountered this problem have resolved it after several attempts, so we recommend that you try it again and again. In addition, most of the white screen cases we have recorded so far are using Lenovo laptops, so please refer to your computer configuration to make a judgement.</p><h2 id="where-are-the-sandbox-levels" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#where-are-the-sandbox-levels"><span>Where are the sandbox levels?</span></a></h2><p>There is a “Sandbox Level” button on the game&#39;s settings screen.
